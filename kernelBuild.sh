# do not run this directly -- read propery
# ubuntu 18.04.1 and kernel 4.20
# run the follwoing commands in your host system
sudo apt-get install bridge-utils

#create a bridge in your system : for example name of your bridge br (check online resouce for static as well as dhcp)
#(no need of disbling network-manager etc : simply change the follwing file)
#create bridge using the file : /etc/network/interfaces
#just after the change : reboot the system
#the brdige should work

# till now you have a bridge: which your new vm can use it to get internet connection and get a IITB network IP

# run the follwoing command in your host system to install kvm qemu etc for virtualization setup.
sudo apt-get install qemu-kvm libvirt-bin virtinst bridge-utils cpu-checker
sudo systemctl enable libvirtd
sudo systemctl start libvirtd
sudo apt-get install virt-manager

#now you have kvm and qemu installted : you can proceed to install a new VM. 
# run sudo virt-manager and create a new VM (ubuntu desktop or server)
#allocate more ram like 3 or 4gb and 2/4 cores(it will make kernel compile faster later). 
# (you reduce these allocation later)
#use br0 bridge as your network connection point

#Now you have a ubuntu machine available insie kvm-qemu setup
#============================================================================================
# run the follwoing commands in your guest system
# start the ubuntu vm and log in.
# you should get an IP address by now.
# connect to iitb internet using your ldap (you might have to use some tools,wget ot culr or browser(in desktop ubuntu only))
